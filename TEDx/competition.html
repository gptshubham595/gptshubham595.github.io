            To clarify what we mean by Taboo and its<strong> interpretation</strong>, we have provided here, for your aid, a comprehensive view of taboos. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Taboo is a practice/action/feeling/thought which is prohibited or restricted by social custom. They are products of ancient experiences and are based on an extremely conservative point of view. With the advancement in science and technology and broadening of social mindsets, a rising trend has seen plethora of questions being asked about the very logic of these taboos thereby allowing their gradual dismantling and reshaping into newer practices. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The theme can be interpreted in a myriad ways. Some interpretations of taboos as perceived by different kind of individuals are as follows.
            <br>
            <br>
            <font color="black">
            <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
                <li>An individual choosing to pursue a profession that has been labelled as gender specific, and thus goes against the societal rules. For example, a man choosing beautician as his career or a woman choosing to be sports coach.</li>
                <li>An individual who is involved in social causes which spread awareness about aspects of human anatomy that are considered a taboo. For example: female menstruation, masturbation, sexual health, contraception, abortion etc.</li> 
                <li>An individual trying to understand the lives of the detested segments of the society and extend help to them. For example, social activists helping transgenders, homosexuals  etc. This also includes individuals who pursue their dreams in spite of the fact that they belong to the aforementioned sections of the society.</li> 
                <li>An individual trying to fight for equality on behalf of a certain section of the society - women, untouchables, differently abled etc.</li>
                <li>An individual trying to preserve and spread their unique culture through various means. Components of remote cultures like dressing and eating habits, rituals and traditions are often considered to be a taboo by the people who are not in direct contact with them. </li>
                <li>Individuals who fight for the freedom to ‘love who they want’, those who believe love has no conditions or seams. This theme would be a reminder of the stigma surrounding inter-caste and inter-religion marriages in our country.</li> 
                <li>Individuals who are trying to reshape or dismantle any pre existing taboos and fighting for the rights of the victims.</li> 
            </ul>
            </font>
            As taboos are passed on across generations, more often than not, they are slightly reshaped. Sometimes they become more stringent, whereas sometimes they loosen up a bit. Moreover, in some scenarios the taboos undergo a drastic change and what emerges is a complete reversal of the whole practice, in terms of the victims of the taboo. With advancement in science and increase in the social sensibilities, the persons who still believe in the practices not backed by a sensible logic, end up being shunned by the society. Hence, sooner or later, the mist clears and “insensibility” turns out to be the biggest taboo of them all.
